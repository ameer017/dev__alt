The following math operations are supported in JavaScript:
Addition +,
Subtraction -,
Multiplication *,
Division /,
Remainder %,
Exponentiation **
Remember If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their precedence, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.
binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:
We know many operators from school. They are things like addition +, multiplication *, subtraction -, and so on. Show examples
Remember If an expression has more than one operator, the execution order is defined by their precedence, or, in other words, the default priority order of operators.
Parentheses override any precedence, so if we’re not satisfied with the default order, we can use them to change it. For example, write (1 + 2) * 2.
Let’s meet features of JavaScript operators that are beyond school arithmetics. So operators like addition works for strings. Show example
