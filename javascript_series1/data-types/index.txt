A String type is used to represent and manipulate a sequence of characters.
A string type must be surrounded by quotes or backticks.
Double and single quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no difference between them in JavaScript.
Backticks are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}
Other quotes don’t have this embedding functionality.
Strings are special types, and therefore have extra functionalities built on it.
