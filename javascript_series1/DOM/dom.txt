All HTML tag in a page is an object. Nested tags are “children” of the enclosing one. The text inside a tag is an object as well.
The Dom tree is a large object representing all page tags. You can see the Dom tree of page by inspecting the page in the developer console

DOM Tree
The backbone of an HTML document is tags.
For example, document.body is the object representing the <body> tag. Run this code : document.body.style.background = “red”
DOM nodes have properties and methods that allow us to travel between them, modify them, move around the page, and more. We’ll get down to them in the next chapters.
